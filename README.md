# Searching for correlations between neutrino events and gravitational transients

In this work, the following was done:
1. Images of neutrino events from 2011–2018 were obtained. As examples, 2011, 2015, and 2017 are shown. The red dot marks the Galactic Center.

2. Also, in another part of the code that is currently under active development, histograms of the distribution of the number of events by declination and right ascension were constructed. The greatest interest lies in the declination diagram. That is the one presented here.
